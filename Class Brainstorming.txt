ElevatorInputPacket (extend DatagramPacket?)
Attributes:
+ Time packet was sent (format hh:mm:ss:SSS)(what built in format to use?) (do we want dates too?)

two main formats:
from elevator car: time, floorRequest, carButton, NULL

Methods:
getTime(): time
getFloor(): int
getFloorButton(): enum(up, down)
getCarButton(): int
